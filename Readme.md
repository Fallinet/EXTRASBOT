The MP4 Feature as the of the date 5/7/2025 it will send an MP4 file but it will not work, that is because of some mistake I made recently that I'll most likely fix 5/8/2025 or 5/9/2025


as of the date 5/6/2025 the bots MP4 feature is working but considering you we only have 8 MB right now it's not really good for downloading youtube videos yet, we are working on getting it verified and up to 100 MB
If you have no idea what MB is which I'm assuming you do if you're on github, it stands for megabyte
